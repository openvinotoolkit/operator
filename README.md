# Openshift and Kubernetes operator

The Operator installs and manages [OpenVINO model servers](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/model_server) in an OpenShift cluster and upstream Kubernetes. It enables inference execution at scale and exposing AI models via gRPC and REST API interfaces.

The Operator also integrates with the JupyterHub Spawner in Red Hat OpenShift Data Science and Open Data Hub. See detailed instructions below.
