# Operator installation

*Note:* Operator, starting from version 1.0 includes non-compatible changes in the CRD records of `ModelServer` and `Notebook`.
It is recommended to remove all those custom records before upgrading the operator from v0.2 to v1.0. 

*Note:* Source code of the versions prior to 1.0.0 is stored in a [github repo](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/model_server/tree/v2022.1/extras)

## Openshift

In the OpenShift [web console](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/web_console/web-console.html) navigate to the OperatorHub menu. Search for "OpenVINOâ„¢ Toolkit Operator". Then, click the `Install` button.
